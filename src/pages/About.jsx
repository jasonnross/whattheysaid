        <p>Note from creator, Jason Ross:</p>
        <p>I created <b>WHAT THEY SAID</b> because I was frustrated by how difficult it was to verify exactly what our politicians did or did not say. Politicians, on all sides, are constantly spewing lies about each other; so I wanted it to be easy to not only fact check them, but to have full-context to exactly what they said.</p>
